    <!-- Create a simple website with 4 divs with no styling. -->
    <script>
      //! Use javascript to select all 4 of them into an array
      //! Shuffle the array into a random order
      //! Going through the array one element at a time have the following happen:
      //!   1. Have the active div change color (to a color of your choice) for 2 seconds.
      //!   2. Reset the color of the active div to it's starting color
      //!   3. After half a second, repeat these steps for the remaining divs.
      //! Take the above code and find a way to have the cycle keep going.
